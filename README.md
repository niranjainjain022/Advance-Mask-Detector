# Advance-Mask-Detector

There are many people out there with their own approach to mask detection. So, here is my approach where the model won't only tell whether the person has worn a mask or not but will tell how has the person worn the mask


TYPES

TYPE 1 - There is no mask on the face.

TYPE 2 - The mask is on, but does not cover the nose or mouth.

TYPE 3 - The mask covers the mouth, but does not cover the nose.

TYPE 4 - The mask is worn correctly, covers the nose and mouth.


ABOUT THE DATA SET: 


250,000 images, 4 types of mask worn, 60,000 unique faces.

All images were collected using the Toloka.ai crowdsourcing service and validated by TrainingData.ru

Each object contains image size, photo type, person's age, gender, user ID.
